# Happy Birthday üéâ

A delightful and customizable web application to send personalized happy birthday wishes to your friends, family, and colleagues! This project combines HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON to create an interactive and engaging birthday greeting.

## Description üéà

This project provides a fun and nerdy way to say "Happy Birthday!" Instead of a generic message, customize a unique webpage with the birthday person's name, a heartfelt message, and even a custom image. Watch as balloons float, confetti falls, and a personalized message appears, all set to a cheerful tune.

-   **Dynamic Content:** JavaScript dynamically inserts the customized content into the HTML.
-   **Interactive Animations:** Engaging animations like confetti, balloons, and typing effects make the greeting more special.
-   **Music Integration:** Adds a festive background music to enhance the celebratory mood.
-   **Responsive Design:** Ensures the greeting looks great on various devices with Bootstrap and custom CSS.
-   **Name Parameter:** Use a URL parameter to dynamically set the name in the birthday message (e.g., `Happy Birthday.html?name=YourName`).
